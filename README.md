## Description:


## What is DOM in JavaScript?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that allows developers to manipulate the content of an HTML or XML document using JavaScript. The DOM represents the document as a tree structure where each node represents an element, attribute, or text.

In JavaScript, the DOM is used to interact with the web page and dynamically update its content. For example, it's possible to add, remove, or modify elements on the page, change the style of elements, and manipulate user events.

In the "JavaScript DOM Quiz" project, the DOM is used to create and manipulate HTML elements and display content dynamically to the user.
